# TodoApp Quality Evaluation Report

## Executive Summary
TodoApp provides reliable core functionality with intuitive task management features, but lacks data persistence and advanced capabilities. The interface is user-friendly though accessibility features are limited. Performance is suitable for typical usage but degrades with large task volumes.

## 1. Functionality Assessment
**Score: 4/5 - Good**

**Advantages:**
The application delivers complete core task management functionality with a well-implemented priority system and reliable reminder features, all supported by robust input validation.

**Weaknesses:**
Significant limitations include the inability to edit existing tasks and the critical absence of data persistence, along with missing organizational features like categories and search functionality.

## 2. Usability Assessment
**Score: 4/5 - Good**

**Advantages:**
The interface offers intuitive navigation with clear visual hierarchy and color-coded priorities, complemented by a straightforward task management workflow that requires minimal learning.

**Weaknesses:**
Usability is hampered by the lack of keyboard shortcuts and poor accessibility support, alongside interface limitations from fixed-width elements that restrict responsive design.

## 3. Performance Efficiency Assessment
**Score: 3/5 - Adequate**

**Advantages:**
The application demonstrates fast response times under normal operating conditions with efficient sorting capabilities and minimal CPU usage during idle periods.

**Weaknesses:**
Performance significantly degrades with larger task volumes due to memory management issues and UI delays, exacerbated by the lack of pagination and complete UI reconstruction during operations.

## Overall Assessment
**Composite Score: 3.7/5**
The application successfully delivers reliable core functionality through a user-friendly interface that meets basic task management needs effectively. However, its practical utility is severely limited by the critical absence of data persistence and task editing capabilities, while performance scalability issues and missing organizational features further constrain its real-world applicability.
